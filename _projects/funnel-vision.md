I submitted a work-in-progress for my CIS 441 final project. I was inspired by a 400-level math course (Intro to Topology), the film Inception, and the video game Portal. I had always wanted to simulate a modified reality using computer programs. What better opportunity than a project for a Computer Graphics class?

The focus of the project is to demonstrate a rendering technique. While I had dreamed of integrating such a technique into a visually stunning virtual environment of exotic artistry, I determined that a complete video game is outside the scope of this project. The project is extensible to large scenes and new camera controls. Perhaps I will expand the art at a later time.

I recorded the time spent on various project-related activities. Here is a rough summary by time period and activity category:
